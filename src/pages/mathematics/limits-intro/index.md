## Limits Intro

To say the limit of a function f(x) means that ƒ(x) can be made as close as desired to L by making x close enough, but not equal, to p.

#### Example

Let f(x) = x. Then the limit of f(x) as x tends to 1 is equal to 1.

When one says that f(x) is very close to L, but does not "touch" it, means that their distance is very small, likewise, x tends to p, but not equal to p, means x is at a small distance from p. For that, the definition of absolute value is used.

  |f(x) - L| < ε , |x - p|< δ
  
The symbols, epsilon and delta, respectively, represent an arbitrarily small number.

That is, whenever a point x is within δ units of c, f(x) is within ε units of L.

#### Properties

Consider that the limits of the functions exist, then:

* **Sum**

The limit of a sum is the sum of the limits.

* **Product**

The limit of a product is the product of the limits.

* **Product by a constant**

You can “factor” a multiplicative constant out of a limit.

* **Division**

The limit of a division is the division of the limits.

* **Power**
